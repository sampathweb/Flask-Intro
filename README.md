Flask-Intro
===========

Sample code from my "Introduction to Flask" presentation.

Flask (`pip install flask`) is required for all the examples. Flask-Bootstrap (`pip install flask-bootstrap`) is required for examples 4 and up. Flask-WTF (`pip install flask-wtf`) is required for examples 5 and up. Example 7 has a `requirements.txt` file that you can use to populate your virtual environment (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
